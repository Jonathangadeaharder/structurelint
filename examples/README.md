# examples

⬆️ **[Parent Directory](../README.md)**

## Overview

The `examples` directory contains example projects and configuration files demonstrating various structurelint use cases and patterns.

## Purpose

- **Documentation by Example**: Show real-world configurations
- **Testing**: Validate that structurelint works with different project structures
- **Learning**: Help users understand how to configure rules for their needs

## Example Scenarios

Each subdirectory (when present) demonstrates a specific pattern:

- Clean Architecture layers
- Monorepo structures
- Feature-sliced design
- Different naming conventions
- Complex layer dependencies

## Using Examples

You can run structurelint on any example to see how it validates the structure:

```bash
cd examples/some-example
structurelint .
```
