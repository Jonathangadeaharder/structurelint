# Template for TypeScript/JavaScript test files
# Enforces Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern for better test readability

required-patterns:
  # Must have at least one test block
  - "it\\(|test\\(|describe\\("

  # AAA pattern comments (at least one test should follow this pattern)
  - "// Arrange|// Act|// Assert"

forbidden-patterns:
  # Discourage testing without expectations
  - "^(?!.*expect\\().*it\\("

  # Discourage overly nested describes
  - "describe\\(.*describe\\(.*describe\\("

# Best practices:
# - Use descriptive test names: it('should do X when Y')
# - One assertion concept per test
# - Clear separation between Arrange, Act, and Assert phases
# - Use beforeEach/afterEach for common setup/teardown
