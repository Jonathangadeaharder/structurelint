# Template for Go test files
# Enforces Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern for better test readability

required-patterns:
  # Test function must exist
  - "func Test\\w+\\(t \\*testing\\.T\\)"

  # AAA pattern comments (at least one test should follow this pattern)
  - "// Arrange|// Act|// Assert"

forbidden-patterns:
  # Discourage testing multiple things in one test
  - "t\\.Run\\(.*t\\.Run\\("  # Nested t.Run indicates complex test

  # Discourage testing without assertions
  # (This is a simplified check - real implementation would be more sophisticated)

# Optional: Could also check for:
# - Table-driven tests with t.Run
# - Proper test naming (Test<FunctionName>_<Scenario>)
# - Setup/teardown patterns
