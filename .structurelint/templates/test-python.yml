# Template for Python test files (pytest/unittest)
# Enforces Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern for better test readability

required-patterns:
  # Must have at least one test function
  - "def test_\\w+\\(|class Test\\w+"

  # AAA pattern comments (at least one test should follow this pattern)
  - "# Arrange|# Act|# Assert"

forbidden-patterns:
  # Discourage testing without assertions
  - "def test_\\w+\\(.*\\):\\s*pass"

  # Discourage too many assertions (suggests testing multiple things)
  # This is a simplified check
  - "assert.*\\n.*assert.*\\n.*assert.*\\n.*assert.*\\n.*assert"

# Best practices:
# - Use descriptive test names: test_function_does_x_when_y
# - One logical assertion per test
# - Clear AAA separation with comments
# - Use fixtures for common setup
# - Use pytest parametrize for similar test cases
